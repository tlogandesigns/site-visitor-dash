## Technical Stack

### Backend:
- FastAPI
- SQLite queries with aggregation
- Role-based access control
- Site filtering

### Frontend:
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Bootstrap 5 for UI
- Chart.js 4.4.0 for visualizations
- Responsive design

### Deployment:
- Docker containerized
- Nginx serving static files
- Volume mounted HTML files

---

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
1. `analytics.html` - Full analytics page (690 lines)
2. `ANALYTICS_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

### Modified:
1. `main.py` - Added `/analytics` endpoint (lines 1027-1115)
2. `index.html` - Added Analytics button (lines 217-219)
3. `docker-compose.yml` - Added analytics.html volume mount (line 41)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries:
- Multiple SELECT queries with GROUP BY
- All queries use appropriate indexes
- Limited to last 30 days for time-series data
- Efficient aggregation

### Frontend:
- Charts destroy/recreate on refresh (prevents memory leaks)
- Loading overlay prevents UI blocking
- Site filter reduces data transferred
- Lazy loading (only loads when page visited)

### Scalability:
- For large datasets (>10k leads), consider:
  - Caching analytics results
  - Background job to pre-compute metrics
  - Pagination for agent performance
  - Date range selector

## Testing Checklist

## API Usage Examples

### Get all analytics:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/analytics
```

### Get analytics for specific site:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/analytics?site=Cedar%20Creek
```

### Response example:
```json
{
  "leads_by_day": [
    {"date": "2025-01-15", "count": 3},
    {"date": "2025-01-16", "count": 5},
    {"date": "2025-01-17", "count": 2}
  ],
  "leads_by_timeline": [
    {"timeline": "0-3 months", "count": 12},
    {"timeline": "3-6 months", "count": 8}
  ],
  "leads_by_price": [
    {"price_range": "$300k-$400k", "count": 15}
  ],
  "leads_by_site": [
    {"site": "Cedar Creek", "count": 20}
  ],
  "leads_by_agent": [
    {"agent_name": "John Doe", "count": 10}
  ],
  "sync_stats": {
    "synced": 45,
    "not_synced": 5
  }
}
```

---

## Deployment Instructions

### Local Development:
```bash
# Rebuild containers to include new analytics.html
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build

# Verify analytics.html is mounted
docker exec newhomes-nginx ls -la /usr/share/nginx/html/

# Should show:
# index.html
# analytics.html
```

### Production (Dokploy):
1. Push changes to git repository
2. Dokploy will auto-rebuild on commit
3. Verify analytics page accessible at: `https://yourdomain.com/analytics.html`
4. Clear browser cache if needed: Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

### Troubleshooting:
- **404 on analytics.html**: Check docker-compose volume mount
- **Charts not rendering**: Check browser console for Chart.js errors
- **No data shown**: Check /analytics API endpoint directly
- **Authentication redirect**: Verify JWT token in localStorage

## Security Notes

- ✅ Authentication required (JWT token)
- ✅ Role-based data filtering enforced on backend
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in frontend code
- ✅ Agent performance chart only visible to admins
- ✅ Site filter parameter sanitized
- ✅ SQL injection prevented (parameterized queries)

---

## Accessibility

- ✅ Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- ✅ Loading states clearly indicated
- ⚠️ Chart.js default accessibility (could be improved)
- ⚠️ Screen reader support for charts (limited)

**Future:** Add ARIA labels and descriptions to charts for better screen reader support
