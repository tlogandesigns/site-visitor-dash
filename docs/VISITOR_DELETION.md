# Visitor Deletion Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented visitor/lead deletion functionality with proper authorization controls. Only administrators (admin and super_admin roles) can delete visitors from the system.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoint ✅

**File:** `main.py`

#### New Endpoint
```python
@app.delete("/visitors/{visitor_id}")
def delete_visitor(visitor_id: int, current_user: UserInDB = Depends(get_current_user))
```

**Features:**
- ✅ **Role-based authorization**: Only admin and super_admin can delete
- ✅ **Cascade deletion**: Automatically deletes associated notes
- ✅ **Error handling**: Returns 404 if visitor not found, 403 for non-admins
- ✅ **Response data**: Returns visitor ID and name in confirmation

**Authorization Check:**
```python
if current_user.role not in ["admin", "super_admin"]:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
        detail="Only administrators can delete visitors"
    )
```

**Cascade Logic:**
```python
# Delete associated notes first (foreign key constraint)
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM visitor_notes WHERE visitor_id = ?", (visitor_id,))

# Then delete visitor
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM visitors WHERE id = ?", (visitor_id,))
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "message": "Visitor deleted successfully",
  "visitor_id": 123,
  "visitor_name": "John Doe"
}
```

---

### 2. Frontend Implementation ✅

**File:** `index.html`

#### A. Delete Button in Visitor Table

**Features:**
- Only visible to admin/super_admin users
- Red trash icon button
- Stops event propagation (doesn't trigger row click)
- Escapes single quotes in visitor names

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const deleteButton = (currentUser.role === 'admin' || currentUser.role === 'super_admin')
    ? `<button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-danger" onclick="event.stopPropagation(); deleteVisitor(${visitor.id}, '${visitor.buyer_name.replace(/'/g, "\\'")}')">
           <i class="bi bi-trash"></i>
       </button>`
    : '';
```

#### B. Delete Button in Visitor Detail Modal

**Features:**
- Hidden by default
- Shown only for admin/super_admin when modal opens
- Red button with trash icon
- Positioned on left side of modal footer
- Data attribute stores visitor name

**HTML:**
```html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-danger" id="deleteVisitorBtn" style="display: none;" onclick="deleteVisitorFromDetail()">
    <i class="bi bi-trash"></i> Delete Lead
</button>
```

**Show/Hide Logic:**
```javascript
const deleteBtn = document.getElementById('deleteVisitorBtn');
if (currentUser.role === 'admin' || currentUser.role === 'super_admin') {
    deleteBtn.style.display = 'block';
    deleteBtn.setAttribute('data-visitor-name', visitor.buyer_name);
} else {
    deleteBtn.style.display = 'none';
}
```

#### C. JavaScript Functions

**1. deleteVisitor(visitorId, visitorName)**
- Triggered from table row delete button
- Shows confirmation modal
- Calls performDeleteVisitor on confirm

**2. deleteVisitorFromDetail()**
- Triggered from modal delete button
- Retrieves visitor name from data attribute
- Shows confirmation modal
- Closes modal after successful deletion

**3. performDeleteVisitor(visitorId, visitorName)**
- Makes DELETE API call
- Handles authentication (401 triggers logout)
- Parses and displays API errors
- Refreshes visitors list and stats on success
- Shows success toast notification

**Confirmation Dialog:**
```javascript
showConfirm(
    `Are you sure you want to permanently delete the lead for "${visitorName}"? This action cannot be undone and will also delete all associated notes.`,
    'Confirm Lead Deletion',
    async () => await performDeleteVisitor(visitorId, visitorName),
    'Delete Lead',
    'btn-danger'
);
```

## Security & Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control

| Role | Can Delete Visitors |
|------|-------------------|
| super_admin | ✅ Yes |
| admin | ✅ Yes |
| user | ❌ No (403 Forbidden) |

### Frontend Security
- Delete buttons hidden from non-admin users via CSS
- JavaScript checks user role before displaying buttons
- Even if users manipulate DOM, backend will reject requests

### Backend Security
- Authorization check at endpoint level
- Returns 403 Forbidden for non-admins
- User role checked from JWT token (cannot be spoofed)

---

## User Experience

### Confirmation Required
All deletion attempts require confirmation via modal dialog:

**Message:**
> "Are you sure you want to permanently delete the lead for '[Name]'? This action cannot be undone and will also delete all associated notes."

**Button:** Red "Delete Lead" button

**Cancel:** Gray "Cancel" button or backdrop click

### Feedback

**Success:**
- ✅ Green toast notification: "Lead '[Name]' deleted successfully"
- ✅ Visitor removed from table immediately
- ✅ Stats updated automatically
- ✅ Modal closes (if deletion from detail view)

**Error:**
- ❌ Red toast notification with specific error message
- ❌ Pydantic validation errors displayed
- ❌ 403 error: "Only administrators can delete visitors"
- ❌ 404 error: "Visitor not found"

---

## Database Behavior

### Cascade Deletion
When a visitor is deleted:
1. ✅ All associated notes are deleted first
2. ✅ Visitor record is deleted
3. ✅ Transaction is committed
4. ✅ Stats automatically update (COUNT queries)

### Foreign Key Constraint
```sql
CREATE TABLE visitor_notes (
    ...
    FOREIGN KEY (visitor_id) REFERENCES visitors(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
    ...
);
```

**Note:** SQLite requires explicit deletion of notes before visitor due to implementation details, even with CASCADE defined.

## API Testing

### Test Deletion (Admin)
```bash
# Get token
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin&password=admin123" | jq -r '.access_token')

# Delete visitor
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/visitors/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Expected response:
{
  "message": "Visitor deleted successfully",
  "visitor_id": 1,
  "visitor_name": "John Doe"
}
```

### Test Authorization (Non-Admin)
```bash
# Login as regular user
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=user&password=password" | jq -r '.access_token')

# Attempt to delete visitor
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/visitors/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Expected response: 403 Forbidden
{
  "detail": "Only administrators can delete visitors"
}
```

### Test Not Found
```bash
# Delete non-existent visitor
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/visitors/99999 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Expected response: 404 Not Found
{
  "detail": "Visitor not found"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Delete Button Not Showing
**Issue:** Admin user doesn't see delete buttons
**Check:**
1. Verify user role is 'admin' or 'super_admin' in database
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify `currentUser` object is populated correctly
4. Clear browser cache and reload

### 403 Forbidden Error
**Issue:** API returns 403 when attempting to delete
**Check:**
1. Verify JWT token contains correct role
2. Check token hasn't expired (8-hour limit)
3. Verify user role in database hasn't changed
4. Re-login to get fresh token

### Notes Not Deleted
**Issue:** Notes remain after visitor deletion
**Check:**
1. Verify foreign key constraint is defined
2. Check SQLite version (should be 3.6.19+)
3. Manually delete notes if needed: `DELETE FROM visitor_notes WHERE visitor_id = ?`

### Stats Not Updating
**Issue:** Stats don't reflect deleted visitor
**Check:**
1. Verify `loadStats()` is called after deletion
2. Check for JavaScript errors in console
3. Manually refresh page to verify deletion
4. Check API response is successful (200 OK)

---

## Documentation Updates

### README.md
Added DELETE endpoint to API reference:
```
DELETE /visitors/{id} - Delete visitor (admin only)
```

### API Documentation
Should be added to OpenAPI/Swagger docs when generated.
